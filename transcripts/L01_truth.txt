Welcome to Philosophy 101. Today we're discussing truth.

What is truth? The correspondence theory says truth is when a statement matches reality. 
If I say "the sky is blue" and the sky really is blue, that statement is true.

But there are problems with this view. First, what does "matches" mean? How do we compare 
a statement to reality? Second, what about statements like "2+2=4"? What reality does that match?

The coherence theory offers an alternative. Truth is coherence with other beliefs. 
A statement is true if it fits consistently with everything else we believe.

But this has issues too. A delusional person might have a perfectly coherent system 
of false beliefs.

Next lecture, we'll explore pragmatist theories of truth.
