Last time we discussed truth. Today: knowledge.

What is knowledge? The traditional definition is "justified true belief." 
You know something if: (1) it's true, (2) you believe it, (3) you have good reasons.

But Gettier (1963) showed this isn't enough. Here's his example: 
Smith believes Jones owns a Ford (good evidence - he's seen Jones driving it). 
Smith also believes "Jones owns a Ford OR Brown is in Barcelona" (disjunction is true if either part is).
But Jones doesn't own a Ford - he was borrowing it. Brown happens to be in Barcelona.
So Smith has a justified true belief that's not knowledge!

This sparked decades of work trying to fix the JTB definition. We'll explore some 
attempts next lecture: causal theories, reliabilism, and virtue epistemology.

One key insight: knowledge requires some kind of proper connection between belief and truth.
Not just luck. You can't just happen to be right - you need to be right for the right reasons.
